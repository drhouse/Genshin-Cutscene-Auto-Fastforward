# Genshin-Cutscene-Auto-Fastforward

Install Autohotkey, run as Administrator.

When a cutscene or npc starts talking that you want to skip, press 'Capslock' key and the script will repeatedly click on the screen to fastforward the speech.

In case of switching windows while the script is running, you can turn it off by pressing the 'Esc' key.
