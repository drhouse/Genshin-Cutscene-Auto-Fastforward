# Genshin-Cutscene-Auto-Fastforward

#### Prerequisites
* Install Autohotkey, download/save the script from [Release](https://github.com/drhouse/Genshin-Cutscene-Auto-Fastforward/releases/tag/v1.0), run as Administrator.
#### Info
* When a cutscene or npc starts talking which you want to skip, press the 'Capslock' key and the script will repeatedly click on the screen to fastforward the speech. It will  click on the spot where the default user chat prompt appears, automatically fastforwarding through everything. Designed for 1920x1080, adjust for different res.
(It can also be used to perform auto normal attacks, example: fast bow shooting)
#### Note
* In case of switching windows while the script is running, you can turn it off by pressing the 'Esc' key.
