# Genshin-Cutscene-Auto-Fastforward

##### First
Install Autohotkey, run as Administrator.
##### Info
When a cutscene or npc starts talking that you want to skip, press 'Capslock' key and the script will repeatedly click on the screen to fastforward the speech. It will click on the spot where user chat default prompt appears, so it will automatically fastforward through everything. Designed for 1920x1080, adjust for different res.
##### Note
In case of switching windows while the script is running, you can turn it off by pressing the 'Esc' key.
