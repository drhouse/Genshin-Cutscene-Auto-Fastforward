# Genshin-Cutscene-Auto-Fastforward

#### First
* Install Autohotkey, save/download script, run as Administrator.
#### Info
* When a cutscene or npc starts talking which you want to skip, press 'Capslock' key and the script will repeatedly click on the screen to fastforward the speech. It will click on the spot where the default user chat prompt appears, so it will automatically fastforward through everything. Designed for 1920x1080, adjust for different res.
#### Note
* In case of switching windows while the script is running, you can turn it off by pressing the 'Esc' key.

alternatively, user KimoriWasTaken has also added randomness to the script to lessen detection:
